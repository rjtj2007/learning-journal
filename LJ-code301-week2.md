# Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal
## Week 2
### Ryan Johnson

Week two helped work throught the git flow process and iron out the details of peer coding in the driver/navigator relationship. Getting this process down has been very difficult and has included out fair share of making mistakes that require backtracking and sorting out but I think I finally have a handle on it.

Two labs this week 03-jQuery and Events as well as 04-templating, continued to build on the previous labs content pages but changed the code to render content in different ways; handlebars. 

we also took on two new code wars challenges and I feel like I am getting a handle on the process for that learning challenge as well.

##Code
Continuing to dive deeper into jQuery we also added handlebars to our code  repertoire and tool belt [link](http://handlebarsjs.com/). This tool uses css syntax to execute java script functions in html code. Very cool.
