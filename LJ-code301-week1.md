# Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal
## Week 1
### Ryan Johnson

We hit the ground running ths week and I am feeling like I am quickly falling behind. The differences between the 201 and 301 course is apperent and very different in many ways.

First, we are now pair-coding all of our labs, requiring full working days with an assigned team mate for our lab days (tuesday, thursday and all day saturday). 

Second, we are beginning each project with started code and working to refactor as well as fill in missing components to fulfill the assignment.

Third, there is a new project called Code Wars which is a code challenge with little to no instruction. New, good, hard, and now after my third 'kata' I think I understand the program a little bit better so that this mini challenge will begin to become just that; mini.

We are learning a lot and I knew that this course would be a big shift in learning and it is proving me right.


##Code
This week we were introduced to jQuery as a tool to write better, faster and more powerful java script. 

Our labs explored replacing var with let and const. As well as creating a file system for CSS code using SMACSS (https://smacss.com/).
    base.css, layout.css, modules.css, normalize.css(also known as reset).
