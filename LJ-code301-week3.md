# Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal
## Week 3
### Ryan Johnson

Week 3 we learned about MVC Model View Controller, invented by Trygve Reenskaug, to create an architectural pattern for dividing up a given application into three interconnected parts.
The Model - models the information requested
The View - displays informaiton for the user from their initial request
The Controler - manipulated by the user

We also learned about the WEB request response cycle
1. Create View in browser (HTTP)
2. Request from Server (HTTP)
3. Query from model (SQL)
4. Result from model (SQL)
5. Response to browser (HTTP)

And we were introduced to JSON, used to store data in a database using "Key"/"Value" pairs contained in strings and AJAX (asynchronous javascript and XML) as a new language used to create asynchronous web applications which increase the efficiency of the site.
