# Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal
## Week 5
### Ryan Johnson

This week started by learning how to use the MAP FILTER and REDUCE with the concept of functional programming built on the ES6 platform.

 We practiced and reviewed SQL syntax and commands to better understand database language,calls, storage and manipulation.

 We were also inroduced to the concepts of CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE), understanding the cycle of data in a user, server, database cycle and practiced wrapping content in an IFFY (immediately invoked function expression).

 Lastly we are practicing using database storeage and manipulation and have been newly introduced to Heroku as a cloud platform server used to support our database for this weeks lab.

Functional Programming - declarative (do this) code as opposed to imperative (step by step) code.
Changing the result of your array but not changing the original data set
MAP returns an array of the same length with different contents.
FILTER removes unwanted bits of information without changing the origional content.
REDUCE take in elements in an array and change them (commonly uses ACC and CUR).

CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)

IIFY immediately invoked function expression
	(function(){
 	 // my special code
	}());
