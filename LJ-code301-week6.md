# Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal
## Week 6
### Ryan Johnson
This week started with reviewing a UI challenge using SPRITES/SPRITY as a tool to upload images with a single HTTP call. I struggled with the lab but I am facinated by the concept and want to spend more time exploring CSS and all that it has to offer.

We also reviewed and applied the .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() methods used last week to apply to our current projects and codewars challenges.

Next we were introduced to the concept of Single Page Applications (SPA), which appear to change from one page to another but in actuality only change the content of the page based on the user's input. This approach is made possible by incorporting a routes.js style file into your project to direct content to be displayed.

Lastly we dug into the concept of Middleware. Middleware is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it, enabling communication and data management for distributed applications, so that different applications can communicate.
