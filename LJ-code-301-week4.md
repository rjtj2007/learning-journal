# Code Fellows 301 Learning Journal
## Week 4
### Ryan Johnson
WOW Week 4, you're crazy! Learning about node.js, express, psql, creating filesystems, middleware, using .gitignore with node modules, and oh yeah node modules, as well as little things like body-parser(which I keep spelling wrong) and all of this a few days before our longest break for Christmas. YIKES!

Node.js - a library to run javaScript code remotely, separate from your browser, as a server/backend. Opened through the command package.json will enable the keys to using node.

Express - a simplified way to build server free web apps.

SQL (‘sequel’)- Structured Query Language
